# SGDK Rocks

My *GoTo* project for learning a new language or development environment
is to code some version of 'Asteroids'. Sometimes it's [pseudo-vector graphics](https://greggallardo.com/Toys/SpaceRocksCS)
and other times it's bitmaped. I don't spend a lot of time getting
the game play right, so the various versions are 'playable' but not
nearly as good as the original. You should visit Atari or a garage sale
if you want the real deal.


## Basic Controls
* Left & Right - Rotate Ship
* UP - Thrust
* Button A - Fire
* Button B - Warp/Blink


## TODO
I'm not sure I like the scrolling aspect of this version. I may get rid 
of it in a later version or borrow ideas from Sinistar.

Depending on free time, I may or may not get around to the TODO list:
* Tighten up collision detection
* Add bonus lives.
* Implement Star/Star-Shard enemy type
* Rethink scrolling playfield / Work on game balance.
* Implement alternate gameplay stages (boss level, vertical Shmup)
